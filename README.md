# Drink-MallBot
##Trial run. My first Telegram bot that works with a simple database. It has two operating modes: an administrator mode (which can add and delete events) and a user mode, which allows purchasing tickets for events and also accessing the up-to-date event list.
###This is the approximate scenario of using the bot by the user

###The bot also has an administrator mode that allows you to add and delete events, change information about events. It works as follows.. There are IDs in the database that belong to administrators, and when the administrator uses the "/admin" command, he gets a special menu that only the administrator has
